      Nopales is a small lamp that you can assemble into a nopal (cactus). The lamp pieces are made from PCB (printed circuit board) that is powered by a CR2032 battery. I was inspired by the customization of the lamp and also how it has many small glowing parts when powered. To reflect these two aspects of Nopales, I drew three different nopal-like figures like Nopales, buidling up in different fragments, and had light shine as if it were a real lamp.
