      I was mainly inspired by DeepTalking5000 and TK1971 – PCBs. I combined these two works because both give me a strong sense of frequency and rhythmic sound. The website opens with the cover video from TK1971 – PCBs. I muted the original audio and kept only the blinking indicator lights. Since my project combines sound detection and a responsive poster, the user’s voice replaces the original sound of the video. The sound recognition text appears briefly in the top right corner. I intentionally kept the information minimal, showing only what is essential. The color palette references and combines colors commonly seen in Tiri’s works
