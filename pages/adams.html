      Almost Surley uses keyboard inputs to direct letters into written paragraphs as you hit the correct set of letters. when you hit a letter that is not yet ready to be typed, it slowly cascades down to the bottom of the screen. I took inspiration from the falling letter and keyboard inputs to create a falling particle system that responds to inputs such as the space bar to reverse gravity as well as other letters that change the color and style of the particles. The inspiration I took from Alt-Text is just the speech synthesis style of audio.
